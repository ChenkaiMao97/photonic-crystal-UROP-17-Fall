# photonic-crystal-UROP-17-Fall

## Introduction
This is an on-going UROP with Yi Yang, graduate student of Prof. Marin Soljačić at MIT.

The project is about designing photonic crystals that have a dirac cone band structure, and study the radiation property of an electron when propagates through it.

The project is done with [MEEP](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (MIT Electromagnetic Equation Propagation), a scheme-based simulation environment developed by Steven G. Johnson et al.


## Folders
The folders test, band, diracCone, Transmission_Spectrum, band are practice examples copied from [meep examples](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Scheme_Tutorials/Basics/).

Most of my own simulation is done in folder TE and radiation, where TE is used for calculating the band structure and tuning parameters, and radiation is when the electron is added and studying the radiation properties.

Folder 3DCode is example code of 3D from Yi Yang, which I haven't studied yet. :joy:
