# photonic-crystal-UROP-17-Fall
This is an on-going UROP with Yi Yang, graduate student of Prof. Marin Soljačić at MIT.

The project is about designing photonic crystals that have a dirac cone band structure, and study the radiation property of an electron when propagates through it.

The project is done with [MEEP](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (MIT Electromagnetic Equation Propagation), a scheme-based simulation environment developed by Steven G. Johnson et al.
